#"PUSH X" -- add X in the stack, where X is a digit.
#"POP" -- look and remove the top position. If the stack is empty, then it returns 0 (zero) and does nothing.
#"PEEK" -- look at the top position. If the stack is empty, then it returns 0 (zero). The stack can only contain digits.
#You should process all commands and sum all digits which were taken from the stack ("PEEK" or "POP"). The initial value of the sum is 0 (zero).

#Let's look at an example, hereâ€™s the sequence of commands:

#["PUSH 3", "POP", "POP", "PUSH 4", "PEEK", "PUSH 9", "PUSH 0", "PEEK", "POP", "PUSH 1", "PEEK"]

#| Command | Stack | Sum 
#|---------|-------|-----
#| PUSH 3  | 3     | 0
#| POP     |       | 0+3
#| POP     |       | 3+0
#| PUSH 4  | 4     | 3
#| PEEK    | 4     | 3+4
#| PUSH 9  | 4,9   | 7
#| PUSH 0  | 4,9,0 | 7
#| PEEK    | 4,9,0 | 7+0
#| POP     | 4,9   | 7+0
#| PUSH 1  | 4,9,1 | 7
